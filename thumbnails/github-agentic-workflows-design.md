# Thumbnail Design: GitHub Agentic Workflows

## Video Title
"GitHub Just Put AI Agents in Your CI/CD (Should You Care?)"

## Design Concept
**Style:** Skeptical Engineer - bold, technical, slightly provocative
**Background:** Dark gradient (deep purple to black) with subtle grid pattern suggesting code/CI/CD pipelines

## Main Visual Elements
1. **GitHub Logo** - prominently displayed but slightly "glitched" or with a question mark overlay
2. **Robot/Agent Icon** - inside the GitHub Actions workflow diagram style
3. **Warning/Doubt Element** - yellow caution stripe or question mark to convey skepticism

## Text Layout
**Top Text:** "GITHUB AGENTS" (bold, white, tech font)
**Middle:** Large question mark or "VS" symbol with GitHub logo vs Agent icon
**Bottom Text:** "IN YOUR CI/CD? 🤔" or "SHOULD YOU CARE?" (yellow/gold for emphasis)

## Color Palette
- Background: #1a1a2e to #0f0f1a (dark purple gradient)
- Primary Text: #ffffff (white)
- Accent: #ffd700 (gold/yellow for skepticism/warning)
- GitHub Pink: #e84d8a (subtle accent)
- Code Green: #00ff41 (matrix-style for CI/CD vibe)

## Mood
Technical, skeptical, attention-grabbing - should make developers pause and think "wait, is this actually good?"

## Dimensions
1280x720 (YouTube thumbnail standard)
